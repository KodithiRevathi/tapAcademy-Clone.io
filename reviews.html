<p align="center">A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
    
    I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February.</p>
    <p align="center">My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming</p>
    <p align="center">I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts <br><br>and technology taught by the trainers.

        Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.<br><br>
        
        Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.
